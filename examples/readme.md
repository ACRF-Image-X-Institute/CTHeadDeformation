# examples

OneAxisRotation.json - Head rotation in *insert direction* axis

OneAxisRotationAndGTVShift.json - Head rotation in *insert direction* axis and a shift of the GTV in the *insert direction*

TwoAxisRotation.json - Head rotation in *insert directions* axes

Elastix_BSpline_OpenCL_RigidPenalty - Elastix parameter file to allow for rigid/non-rigid registration

To do the deformation described in the json file OneAxisRotation.json, in a command window run 'python DeformVolume.py OneAxisRotation.json' 

This folder should contain a few example scripts of using the code in MyPackage.
Ideally, the docs would explain the context of these examples: what the problem is and how it's being solved.
